# AI Alignment & XAI Repository

Welcome to the **AI Alignment & Explainable AI (XAI)** repository! This repository is dedicated to exploring two critical areas of AI research: **AI alignment** and **explainability**. Through research papers, analyses, and code demonstrations, we dive into ensuring that AI systems are aligned with human values and are transparent, interpretable, and accountable.

## Overview

As AI systems become increasingly integral to critical decision-making processes, **AI alignment** ensures that these systems' goals, behaviors, and outcomes align with human values, intentions, and societal norms. However, **we cannot fully ensure that AI is aligned with human thinking and values unless these systems are interpretable and explainable**. **Explainable AI (XAI)** is vital to achieving this goal by making AI models more transparent and understandable.

The repository will be organized into the following topics:

### Topics

- Shared Interest & Human Alignment 
- Adversarial AI Safety Defense & Attack 
- Interpretable ML  
- Explainable ML
- Explainable Deep Learning  
- XAI in LLM's  
- Mechanistic Interpretability  
- Human-AI Interaction  
- AI Alignment  

## What to Expect

Each topic will be covered through:

- **Research Papers**: Relevant papers that address the topic, including an analysis of the key concepts.
- **Code Examples**: Jupyter notebooks and Python scripts that demonstrate practical applications of XAI concepts. These examples will help you experiment with models and understand how explainability techniques are applied in practice.
- **Discussions**: Insights and reflections on how XAI aligns with human reasoning, ethical considerations, and the future of AI interpretability.


## Conclusion

As AI becomes more powerful and pervasive, ensuring that it is aligned with human values is not just an option but a necessity. **However, true alignment cannot be achieved without interpretability and explainability**, as opaque AI systems pose risks of unintended consequences and ethical concerns. This repository is a resource for researchers and practitioners looking to deepen their understanding of AI alignment and explainability and to ensure that AI systems are both safe and accountable.
