# Explainable AI (XAI) Repository

Welcome to the Explainable AI (XAI) repository! This repository is dedicated to exploring the rapidly growing field of XAI through research papers, analyses, and code demonstrations.

## Overview

Explainable AI focuses on making AI systems more interpretable, transparent, and understandable to humans. As AI becomes more integrated into decision-making processes, it is crucial to ensure that AI models are not only accurate but also explainable. This repository will help explore various aspects of XAI, including adversarial attacks, model interpretability, explainability techniques for machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL), as well as human-AI interaction and alignment.

The repository will be organized into the following topics:

### Topics

- Shared Interest & Human Alignment 
- Adversarial AI Safety Defense & Attack 
- Interpretable ML  
- Explainable ML
- Explainable Deep Learning  
- XAI in LLM's  
- Mechanistic Interpretability  
- Human-AI Interaction  
- AI Alignment  

## What to Expect

Each topic will be covered through:

- **Research Papers**: Relevant papers that address the topic, including an analysis of the key concepts.
- **Code Examples**: Jupyter notebooks and Python scripts that demonstrate practical applications of XAI concepts. These examples will help you experiment with models and understand how explainability techniques are applied in practice.
- **Discussions**: Insights and reflections on how XAI aligns with human reasoning, ethical considerations, and the future of AI interpretability.
