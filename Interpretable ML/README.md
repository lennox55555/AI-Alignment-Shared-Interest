# Interpretable Machine Learning Models Repository

Welcome to the **Interpretable Machine Learning** folder. This section focuses on comparing interpretable machine learning models, with a specific interest in understanding how these models can be used in practical settings, especially for tasks such as predicting customer churn. The goal is to maintain a balance between model performance and interpretability, ensuring that the models are not only accurate but also explainable.

## Overview

This repository contains:

- **Jupyter Notebook**: A comprehensive analysis comparing interpretable models like **Logistic Regression** and **Generalized Additive Models (GAM)**. The goal was to evaluate their performance on a binary classification task (churn prediction) and assess how well they balance interpretability and accuracy.
  
- **ROC Curve Comparison**: Visual representation of the model performance, plotting the ROC curves for both Logistic Regression and GAM to evaluate their discriminative power.

- **Model Metrics**: Analysis of key metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, f1-score, and ROC AUC to help decide which model performs better while remaining interpretable.

## Purpose of This Repository

Iâ€™m particularly interested in exploring **interpretable machine learning models** that can be applied in real-world tasks where transparency is critical. This repository serves as a workspace for my research and experiments on comparing these models.

### Key Goals:
  
- **Comparing Interpretability**: Examining the balance between interpretability and predictive power in models like Logistic Regression and GAM. These models are known for their relatively high explainability, making them ideal candidates for applications in which decisions need to be understood by end-users (e.g., in healthcare, finance, or customer churn prediction).

- **Model Performance Evaluation**: Beyond interpretability, the notebook delves into accuracy, precision, recall, f1-score, and ROC AUC metrics to compare how well the models perform in classifying binary outcomes (churn or not churn).

- **Visualizing Model Differences**: By plotting the **ROC curves** for both Logistic Regression and GAM, this analysis allows for a straightforward comparison of the models' performance in distinguishing between classes.

- **Exploring Trade-offs**: While GAM provides more flexibility in modeling non-linear relationships, Logistic Regression offers simplicity and ease of interpretation. The analysis explores this trade-off to determine which model may be more appropriate in different scenarios.

## Structure

1. **Notebook**:
   - [InterpretableML.ipynb](./InterpretableML.ipynb): The Jupyter notebook contains all the code, data processing steps, model training, evaluation, and visualizations comparing the interpretable models.

2. **Model Metrics**:
   - Logistic Regression: Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, Precision, Recall, and ROC AUC score of **0.85**.
   - Generalized Additive Model (GAM): Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, Precision, Recall, and ROC AUC score of **0.82**.

3. **ROC Curves**:
   - A side-by-side comparison of the ROC curves for both Logistic Regression and GAM, showing the performance differences visually.

## Insights from the Analysis

- **Logistic Regression**: Simpler, more interpretable, and slightly better at distinguishing between churners and non-churners, as indicated by its higher ROC AUC score (0.85 vs 0.82).
  
- **GAM**: Provides more flexibility to model non-linear relationships but comes at the cost of slightly lower performance and complexity in interpretation.

## Conclusion

For tasks that prioritize **transparency and ease of interpretation**, **Logistic Regression** may be the model of choice due to its balance between interpretability and strong performance. However, **GAM** offers an alternative when flexibility in modeling relationships is required, even though it might sacrifice some performance and simplicity.

## How to Use the Repository

To explore the notebook:
- Open the [InterpretableML.ipynb](./InterpretableML.ipynb) notebook.
- Run through the cells to see how the data is processed, models are trained, and evaluations are performed.

## Future Work

- **Model Explainability**: Further work on using SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) or LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations) to improve the interpretability of the GAM model.
- **Adding More Models**: Future additions could include other interpretable models such as Decision Trees or Rule-based models to expand the scope of the comparison.
